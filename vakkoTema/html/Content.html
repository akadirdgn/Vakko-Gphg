          <p>
            Established in 2001, the Foundation of the Grand Prix
            d'Horlogerie de Genève (GPHG) is a non-profit organization with
            a commitment to celebrating and promoting the watchmaking art.
          </p>
          <p>
            The GPHG notably plays this unifying promotional role by staging
            an annual competition involving several hundreds of watches
            marketed during the year and attributing the highest awards in
            this domain. In doing so, it contributes to enhancing the
            traditions, skills and values of Swiss - and indeed universal -
            watchmaking culture.
          </p>

            The GPHG awards ceremony held in November of each year draws
            elite representatives of the international watchmaking
            profession, united in honouring the finest creations and
            stakeholders who daily breathe vitality and creativity into the
            watchmaking world. Twenty or so prizes, including the "Aiguille
            d'Or" Grand Prix (Best in Show) distinction are awarded on this
            occasion.
          </p>
          <p>
            Each autumn, in the run-up to the annual awards ceremony, the
            GPHG organises a travelling exhibition stopping off in the
            world's major cities presenting the nominated watches. Each of
            these exhibitions enables a cosmopolitan public to discover and
            admire the most beautiful timepieces of the year, exceptionally
            brought together in various key locations. The winning watches
            are also exhibited after the awards ceremony.
